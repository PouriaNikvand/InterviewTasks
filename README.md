<h1><strong>This repository is built for interview tasks.</strong></h1>

<strong>For each task, you can read the `README.md` file in each folder. </strong>


<h2>Do as much as you can! 🙏💪🙏</h2>

<strong>We value your efforts and the way you look at the issue, not the outcome </strong>

<h2>IMPORTANT NOTES</h2>

These parts are the most important for us:
- For each task, you have to build a Github repository and use that repo for coding.
- Your nice and clean codes besides your comments on them are too valuable for us. So try not to be rude!
- You have to prepare good documentation about what and why you have done anything in your code. So try to explain and analyze as much as you want.
- Your projects have to be able to run for us using very simple installations. So try to makes it easy to run! 😅😁



<h2>Nice Quotes</h2>

“It’s basically code that other developers can understand,” Paulo said. “That’s the basic principle of clean code. Because you don’t write code for a machine to understand, you don’t write for yourself, you write for other developers. Other people will need to read your code and change your code and fix bugs and add more features.”
